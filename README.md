# job-title-generator

Funny little random job title generator. I have created this simple programme after seeing so many
weird-sounding and complicated job titles on Linkedin and similar websites. It made impression to me that those job titles
must have been made using some kind of generator. So I decided to create my own. I have used this as a way to practice
my Python and JavaScript skills.

Python application:
Just press ENTER repeatedly to create different random job titles based on four words sources. Press "q" to quit.
Enjoy.

Web JS version:
Click on "Generate job title" to generate new random title. Must be run under a webserver (just loading index.html in web browser will not work). Live version at: http://tomas.krivda.eu/job-title-generator/
