# job-title-generator
Funny little random job title generator. I have crated this simple programme after seeing so many 
weird sounding and complicated job titles on Linkedin and similar websites. It made impression to me that those job titles
must have been made using some kind of generator. So I decided to create my own. I have used this as a way to practice 
my Python skills where I am still a beginner.

Just press ENTER repeatedly to create different random job titles based on four words sources. Press "q" to quit.
Enjoy.
